# Notes for Major Studio
## HTML, SVG, canvas

### HTML
- just `<div>`, not including `<canvas>`
-  one DOM element per data point
- integraiton with CSS can simplify the work

### SVG
- Lots of D3 are built around it
- **pro**: very customizable shapes/ styles
- **con**: lots of rules. slow at scale

### canvas
- totally customizable
- good for animation/ frame
- 2D and 3D contexts
- P5 uses it, as do WebGL libraries
- **pro**: fast at scale
- **con**:: stateless; mouse events are harder

## Examples:
- see Google Drive

## Tools
- P5
- D3
- Vega
- Tableau
- Chart.js
- Highcharts
- Plot.ly

## Strategies for approaching new tools
- read the doucmentations: it is user-friendly?
- look at examples made with the tool: are they attractive? varied?
- find the sweet spot between using your skills and stretching in new directions
- engage with user community online or in person
