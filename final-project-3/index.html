                What’s the last time you read time from a clock? For me, surrounded by digital devices such as laptops, smartphones, and smartwatches, clocks are no longer important to keep track of time. 
                However, clocks have been playing a critical role since more than a thousand years ago in the form of <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/576278">shadow clocks</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/572126">water clocks</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206322">mechanical clocks</a>, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what does a clock look like in your memory? In my impression, besides the world’s famous clocks such as Big Ben, most of the clocks I have seen were designed with a simple clock face and hanging on the wall. While I was exploring clocks in the MET collections, I surprisedly found that clocks are not just limited in a similar design and a similar size. 
                In this project, I will be visualizing the story behind each clock in the MET.

                    In the MET collection, among 500+ clocks exhibitors, 92 exhibitors include accurate measurements in three dimensions, <strong>height, width, and depth</strong> . 
                    <br>
                    For this project, I will only focus on exhibitors that include three dimension measurements documented by the MET.

                    This isometric skeleton interprets the dimension of object 7421, Shelf Clock, into an isometric cuboid. With the cuboid, I will be analyzing the dimension of each object in
                    three faces: <strong>front, side, and up</strong> .

                    In the example of object 7421, the <strong>height</strong>  is 83.2 cm, the <strong>width</strong> is 29.2 cm, and the <strong>depth</strong> is 14 cm.

                    I did the same process for all <strong>92 objects</strong> and generated the following graph from three perspectives.

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I found out that the <strong>average width</strong>  of all 92 objects is 37.5 cm, the <strong> average height</strong> is 108.8 cm, and the <strong>average depth</strong>  is 
                    21 cm.

                    In terms of the <strong> largest dimension</strong>, the <strong>tallest clock</strong>  is 311 cm, the <strong>widest clock</strong>  is 104 cm, and the <strong>thickest clock</strong>  is 45 cm.

               Due to the time limit, I was not able to finish all of my idea by today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next step, I will be visualize information more than just the dimension, including culture, time, etc.
