Carved in low relief, the monumental yet softly rounded thuluth inscription carries the same weight as the large-scale arabesque decoration with interlacing rumi or split-palmette leaves and trefoil-like flowers.  The Arabic inscription proclaims the Shi’a profession of fait: “There is no God but God; Muhammad is the Prophet of God and ‘Ali is the friend of God.”","dimensions":"H. 13 in. (33 cm)\r\nMax.
